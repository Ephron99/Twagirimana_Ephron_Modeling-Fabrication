It is an iterative cycle:</p> <ol> <li>Design: Establishing intent.</li> <li>Model: Representing form, logic, and behavior.</li> <li>Prototype: Testing assumptions.</li> <li>Fabricate: Transforming models into physical artifacts.</li> <li>Evaluate: Using feedback to improve the design.</li> </ol> Digital Modeling Modeling Workflow <p>Modeling is more than just creating a shape; it is the representation of form, logic, and behavior. My workflow incorporates two distinct approaches:</p> <ol> <li>Geometric Modeling: Defining static shapes and physical dimensions.</li> <li>Parametric &amp; Rule-Based Modeling: Using parameters to enable variation without needing to redesign the entire object.</li> </ol> Design Decisions <p>Every design choice was made with the understanding that fabrication method is a design choice.</p> Parametric Thinking <p>By utilizing parametric thinking, I treat my models as research tools. This allows me to:</p> <ul> <li>Test assumptions about fit and function.</li> <li>Quickly adjust variables when physical constraints change.</li> </ul> <p>A parametric model.</p> Fabrication Logic Fabrication Paradigms <p>To transform my digital models into physical reality, I considered the four main paradigms of digital fabrication:</p> Additive             Layer-by-layer construction e.g., 3D Printing.          Subtractive             Removing material e.g., CNC Milling          Formative             Shaping via molds and forces.          Hybrid             Combining methods for optimal results.          Material &amp; Tolerance Considerations <p>Real-world fabrication introduces physical constraints that digital models often ignore.</p> Reflections and Outcomes The Iterative Process <p>The most important lesson from this module is that the process is iterative, not linear. Feedback was gathered at every stage, allowing me to refine the design before final production.</p> Failures as Learning <p>I treated every prototyping failure not as a mistake, but as a learning tool. This \"evidence in design inquiry\" helped me understand the limitations of my chosen machines.</p> Ethics &amp; Sustainability <p>Beyond the technical skills, I reflected on the ethical implications of my work:</p> <ul> <li>Sustainability: considering material waste and energy use.</li> <li>Responsibility: Designing for reuse and repair rather than disposability.</li> </ul> Final Learning Outcomes <p>Through this project, I have learned to:</p> <ol> <li>Design with fabrication logic in mind.</li> <li>Understand material behavior and its impact on form.</li> <li>Translate ideas into buildable, functional systems.</li> </ol> <p></p> <p></p>"},{"location":"Daily-Activity/day_2/","title":"Day 2","text":"Activity of Day 2 Digital Modeling: L-Bracket Project Project Overview <p>Objective: Design a structural L-shaped bracket using FreeCAD.</p> <p>Design Intent: Create a robust mounting point with 90\u00b0 geometry, reinforced mounting holes, and stress-relieving fillets.</p> <p>Software: FreeCAD (Part Design Workbench).</p> Modeling Workflow <p>My workflow follows the standard Parametric Modeling approach: Sketch, Constrain, Extrude, Refine.</p> Phase 1: Creating the Base Body (Additive) Step 1: Setup &amp; Sketch <p>I started by creating a new Body in the Part Design Workbench and selecting the XY Plane.</p> <ul> <li>Tool Polyline <code>CreatePolyline</code></li> <li>Action: Drew a rough \"L\" shape starting from the origin (0,0).</li> <li>Constraints: <ul> <li>Applied Vertical and Horizontal constraints to ensure 90\u00b0 angles.</li> <li>Vertical Height: 60mm</li> <li>Horizontal Length: 40mm</li> <li>Thickness: 10mm (uniform)</li> </ul> </li> </ul> Parametric Logic <p>By fully constraining the sketch (turning the lines green), I ensure that the dimensions can be easily modified later without breaking the model geometry.</p> Step 2: Padding (Extrusion) <p>Once the 2D profile was defined, I transformed it into a 3D solid.</p> <ul> <li>Tool Pad <code>PartDesign_Pad</code></li> <li>Parameter Length = 40mm</li> <li>Result: A solid 3D block representing the raw material volume.</li> </ul> <p>Screenshot of the Extruded L-Shape</p> Phase 2: Adding Features (Subtractive &amp; Refinement) Step 3: Creating Holes <p>To allow for mounting screws, I used a Subtractive process to remove material.</p> <ol> <li>Select Face: Clicked the top flat face of the bracket.</li> <li>Sketch: Drew a circle and constrained the radius to 2.5mm (for M5 bolts).</li> <li>Tool Pocket <code>PartDesign_Pocket</code> set to \"Through All\".</li> </ol> Repeating this process on the vertical face ensures the bracket can be mounted on two axes.

Core Philosophy: Designing Material Processes <p>In modern engineering, materials are not just components; they are the foundation of design. The key takeaway from our coursework is that we do not design objects\u2014we design material processes.</p> Materials as Design Drivers <p>Materials are never neutral. They dictate form, influence structural integrity, and define the fabrication logic. A design must align the material + process for optimal results.</p> 2. Material Intelligence <p>Selecting the right material requires understanding its inherent properties and limitations.</p> Wood - Nature's Versatile Material <ul> <li>Properties: Renewable, distinctive grain patterns.</li> <li>Critical Constraint: Wood is anisotropic\u2014it behaves differently along and across the grain. This directionality affects how it bends and breaks.</li> <li>Best For: Furniture, architectural models, rapid prototyping.</li> <li>Fabrication: CNC Routing, Laser Cutting.</li> </ul> Plastics - Lightweight &amp; Adaptable <ul> <li>Types: Thermoplastics (PLA, ABS) and Thermosets.</li> <li>Best For: 3D printing, laser cutting.</li> </ul> Heat Sensitivity <p>Heat significantly affects plastics, often more than their geometric form. Watch for melting or warping during fabrication.</p>  Metals - Strength &amp; Precision <ul> <li>Common Types: Aluminum (lightweight), Steel (high strength), Brass (conductive).</li> <li>Trade-off: High strength typically comes with increased cost and energy consumption.</li> <li>Fabrication: CNC Milling (subtractive), Sheet Metal Forming.</li> </ul>  Composites - Engineered Performance <ul> <li>Definition: Combining multiple materials (e.g., Fiberglass, Carbon Fiber) to achieve properties not found in individual components.</li> <li>Benefit: Extreme strength-to-weight ratio.</li> <li>Challenge: Complex recycling and fabrication methods.</li> </ul> 3. The Fabrication Continuum <p>We categorize fabrication into two fundamental approaches:</p> A. Subtractive vs. Additive Feature Subtractive Manufacturing Additive Manufacturing Process Removing material from a block Building objects layer-by-layer Examples CNC Milling, Laser Cutting 3D Printing Strengths Precision and surface finish Complexity and customization B. Hybrid Fabrication <p>Advanced manufacturing often combines these methods. For example, using CNC machining to refine a 3D printed part. This \"Cross-Process Planning\" leverages the strengths of both machines to accelerate prototyping.</p> 4. Design Logic &amp; Constraints Material Form Factors <ul> <li>Sheet Materials: (Plywood, Acrylic) Ideal for 2D/2.5D processes like laser cutting. This promotes \"Assembly Thinking\" (interlocking parts).</li> <li>Solid Stock: (Blocks, Bars) Used for structural components and subtractive 3D forms.</li> </ul> Forces at Play <p>During fabrication, materials react to five external forces:</p> 1. Compression             Pushing          2. Tension             Pulling/Stretching          3. Shear             Sliding          4. Torsion             Twisting          5. Bending             Flexing          Designing for Assembly <p>Assembly is often the core fabrication method itself. Using smart joinery (like Box Joints, Dovetails, or Press-fits) can reduce the need for adhesives and fasteners.</p> 5. Learning from Failure <p>In our lab, failure is treated as data, not a mistake. Common failure modes include:</p> <ul> <li>Warping: Signals uneven cooling or internal stress.</li> <li>Cracking: Indicates excessive stress or brittle material properties.</li> <li>Delamination: Suggests poor adhesion between layers (common in 3D printing).</li> </ul> 6. Ethics &amp; Sustainability <p>Every fabrication choice carries an ethical weight:</p> <ul> <li>Local Availability: Choosing materials found in the immediate region reduces transportation impact and fosters community resilience.</li> <li>Repairability: Designing with common materials ensures products can be repaired locally, extending their lifespan.</li> <li>Efficiency: Can this design do more with less material?</li> </ul> <p></p> <p></p>"},{"location":"Daily-Activity/day_5/","title":"Day 5","text":"Activity of Day 5 Laser Cutting Machine Activity <p>Computer-Aided Design and Digital Fabrication Using Laser Cutter</p> Objective <p>The objective of this activity is to introduce students to laser cutting technology for digital fabrication.</p> <p>Students will design a 2D object using vector-based software and fabricate it using a laser cutting machine.</p> <p>By the end of this task, students will understand the full workflow from digital design to physical production.</p> Functional Description <ul> <li>Students design a 2D vector file</li> <li>The design is prepared according to laser cutting constraints</li> <li>The file is sent to a laser cutting machine</li> <li>The final object is cut from sheet material such as plywood or acrylic</li> </ul> Machine Used <p>Laser Cutting Machine</p> <p>Common types:</p> <ul> <li>CO\u2082 Laser Cutter</li> <li>Desktop or Industrial Laser Cutter</li> </ul> Materials Material Thickness Notes Plywood 3 mm Easy to cut, beginner-friendly Acrylic 3 mm Clean edges, requires ventilation Cardboard 2\u20133 mm Good for testing designs Tools &amp; Software Design Software             Inkscape          Laser Control             LightBurn, RDWorks, LaserGRBL          Hardware             Laser Cutter Machine          Safety Precautions Laser safety is critical <p>Students must:</p> <ul> <li>Never leave the laser cutter unattended</li> <li>Wear safety glasses if required</li> <li>Ensure proper ventilation is ON</li> <li>Keep flammable materials away</li> <li>Stop the machine immediately if fire occurs</li> <li>Be supervised by a trained instructor</li> </ul> Design to Fabrication Workflow Step 1 \u2013 Design the 2D Model <p>Students must:</p> <ul> <li>Create a 2D vector design</li> <li>Use closed paths only</li> <li>Convert all lines to vectors</li> <li>Use real dimensions (mm)</li> </ul> <p>Recommended: Object size smaller than 300 \u00d7 200 mm</p> Step 2 \u2013 Design Rules for Laser Cutting Rule Value Stroke color Red (RGB: 255, 0, 0) Stroke width 0.01 mm (hairline) Units Millimeters No fills Cutting only Note: Different labs may use different color rules.

In this process, the printer builds objects layer-by-layer by melting and extruding plastic filaments.</p> 1. Machine &amp; Materials <p>The Ultimaker is a desktop FDM printer known for reliability and precision. Before printing, it is critical to select the right material for the job.</p> Material Properties Best Application PLA Biodegradable, easy to print. General prototyping, visual models. ABS Strong, temperature-resistant. Functional parts, mechanical gears. PETG Impact-resistant, combines PLA ease with ABS strength. Snap-fits, protective cases. TPU Flexible and rubber-like. Phone cases, seals, gaskets. 2. The Printing Workflow Phase A: Slicing (Ultimaker Cura) <p>Before the printer can move, the digital 3D model (STL/OBJ) must be \"sliced\" into G-code instructions.</p> Key Slicing Settings <ul> <li>Layer Height: Determines resolution. Lower (e.g., 0.1mm) is smoother but slower.</li> <li>Infill Density: Controls internal strength. 20% is standard; 100% is solid.</li> <li>Supports: Essential for overhangs greater than 45\u00b0.</li> </ul> Phase B: Printer Setup 1. Load Filament <p>Feed the filament into the extruder path. Ensure the material matches the Cura profile!</p> 2. Level Build Plate <p>Critical Step: The build plate must be perfectly level to ensure the first layer adheres correctly. Use the manual leveling screws or auto-calibration if available.</p> 3. Clean Surface <p>Wipe the glass plate with isopropyl alcohol to remove oils (fingerprints) that cause warping.</p> 3. Operations &amp; Troubleshooting Monitoring the Print Watch the First Layer <p>Always monitor the first few layers. Most failures (like detachment) happen here. If the nozzle is too high, the plastic won't stick; too low, and it will block flow.</p> Common Issues &amp; Fixes Issue Symptom Solution Warping Corners lifting off the plate. Clean the bed, use glue stick, or increase bed temperature. Stringing Fine plastic hairs between parts. Lower nozzle temperature or increase retraction settings. Under-extrusion Gaps or thin layers. Check for nozzle clogs or filament tangles. 4. Safety Guidelines <p>Operating a 3D printer involves high heat and moving parts.</p> <ul> <li>Heat Hazard: The nozzle reaches 200\u00b0C+ and the bed 60\u00b0C+. Do not touch these components during operation.</li> <li>Ventilation: Ensure the room is well-ventilated, especially when printing materials like ABS that release fumes.</li> <li>Supervision: Never leave the printer unattended for long periods.</li> </ul> 5.

Unlike 3D printing which builds layers, the CNC router starts with a solid sheet of material and cuts away the excess using a spinning tool.</p> 1. Systems &amp; Components <p>Understanding the machine architecture is the first step to safe operation.</p> Spindle <p>The motor that rotates the cutting tool (End Mill).</p> Gantry <p>The bridge that moves the spindle along the X and Y axes.</p> Bed/Spoilboard <p>The sacrificial layer (usually MDF) that supports the stock material.</p> Collet <p>The cone-shaped sleeve that grips the tool bit.</p> 2. Tooling &amp; Material Compatibility <p>Selecting the right \"End Mill\" (bit) is critical for finish quality and machine safety.</p> Tool Type Geometry Best Application Flat End Mill Flat tip Cutting profiles, pockets, and straight edges. Ball Nose Mill Rounded tip 3D contouring, curved surfaces. V-Bit V-shaped tip Engraving text, chamfering edges. Compression Bit Up/Down spiral Cutting plywood without chipping the top or bottom veneer. Feeds &amp; Speeds <p>Every material (Plywood, Acrylic, Aluminum) requires a specific Feed Rate (speed of movement) and Spindle Speed (RPM). Running too fast can break the bit; too slow can burn the material.</p> 3. CAM Workflows &amp; Toolpath Strategies <p>Computer-Aided Manufacturing (CAM) is the bridge between your CAD design and the machine.</p> Core Toolpath Strategies 1. Profile / Contour <p>Cutting along the outline to separate the part from the sheet.</p> 2. Pocketing <p>Clearing out an internal area to a specific depth (not cutting through).</p> 3. Drilling <p>Creating vertical holes for screws or alignment.</p> 4. Engraving <p>Following a line on the surface for text or artwork.</p> Nesting &amp; Optimization <p>Nesting is the process of arranging multiple parts on a single sheet to maximize yield and minimize waste.</p> <ul> <li>Gap: Always leave at least 2x Tool Diameter between parts for stability.</li> <li>Tabs: Small bridges of material left behind to hold the part in place so it doesn't fly loose when cut.</li> </ul> 4. Design for CNC Fabrication <p>CNC routers have physical limitations that usually dictate the design logic.</p> The \"Internal Corner\" Problem <p>Because the cutting tool is round, a CNC router cannot cut a sharp internal 90\u00b0 corner. The radius of the tool will always remain.</p> Solution: Dog-Bones &amp; T-Bones <p>To fit a rectangular tenon into a slot, we must create \"Dog-Bone\" fillets (over-cutting the corners) to allow the mating part to seat fully square.</p> Tolerances &amp; Press-Fit Joinery <p>For parts to snap together without glue (Press-Fit), tolerances must be exact.</p> <ul> <li>Kerf/Runout: The actual cut width is often slightly larger than the tool diameter due to vibration.</li> <li>Offset: Designing parts with a 0.1mm - 0.2mm interference for a tight friction fit.</li> </ul> 5. Assembly &amp; Structural Evaluation <ul> <li>Joinery: Using Mortise &amp; Tenon or Box Joints for mechanical strength.</li> <li>Structural Evaluation: Checking if the sheet material direction (grain) aligns with the load-bearing requirements of the assembly.</li> </ul> <p></p> <p></p>"}]}
